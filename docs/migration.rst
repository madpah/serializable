Migration
=========

.. _v1_v2:

From v1 to v2
-------------

The python package was renamed from ``serializable`` to ``py_serializable``.
Therefore, you need to adjust your imports.

The following shows a quick way to adjust imports in the most efficient way.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: OLD imports

   import serializable
   from serializable import ViewType, XmlArraySerializationType, XmlStringSerializationType
   from serializable.helpers import BaseHelper, Iso8601Date


.. code-block:: python
   :caption: ADJUSTED imports

   import py_serializable as serializable
   from py_serializable import ViewType, XmlArraySerializationType, XmlStringSerializationType
   from py_serializable.helpers import BaseHelper, Iso8601Date


Also, you might need to adjust the logger access:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: OLD logger access

   s_logger = logging.getLogger('serializable')


.. code-block:: python
   :caption: NEW logger access

   s_logger = logging.getLogger('py_serializable')
